Due to licensing JAR files for Sun JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extension)
are not included. However build script will detect and use them
automatically when dropped into this directory.
On instructions how to get JSSE please see: http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/
NOTE: JSSE is now included in JDK 1.4.
