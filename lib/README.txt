This directry contains JAR files that can be used to build 
and execute samples and tests and are included here to make
building easy and to minimize external dependencies 
(that allows us to check out old version from CVS and have
them running even after few months...).

JAR files inside subdirectories are automatically 
picked up by build and executio scripts.

Of course source code can be compiled and used 
with other JARs as long as they provide compatible APIs.

See README files in subdirectories for details.
