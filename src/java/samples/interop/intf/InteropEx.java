/**
 * Extension of interop test for proposed circular list.


Check supporting cyclic graphs that should allow
to serialize and deserialize this example:

LinkedList a = new LinkedList();
a.x = 1;
LinkedList b = new LinkedList();
a.next = b;
b.x = 7;
LinkedList c = new LinkedList();
b.next = c;
c.x = 8;
c.next = a;

Check deserializing mixed multi-ref and recursive serialization:

<a id='id1'>
   <x>1</x>
   <next id='id2'>
     <x>7</x>
     <next href='#id3'/>
   </next>
</a>
<b id='id3'>
  <x>8</x>
  <next href='#id1'/>
</b>


 *
 * In future maybe also Hashmap / Associative array (as in Apache SOAP).
