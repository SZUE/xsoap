Serp uses the BSD license. This is the most open license I could find; 
the goal is that regardless of your application -- commercial or non-commercial, 
open source or closed -- you can take advantage of the utilities serp provides, 
or even modify them to suit your needs... without any legal issues. 
Also, as in all open source, access to the source code means that you have the opportunity 
to fix blocking bugs without waiting for the next release. 
The following is the text of the license:
