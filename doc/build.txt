Building XSOAP
--------------


NOTE: XSOAP distribution already contains JAR files and 
precompiled samples so building is not necessary 
unless you make changes to XSOAP.

XSOAP uses simply scripted build system on top ANT.

First make sure that JAVA_HOME environment variable points
to your installation of JDK version 1.3 or above.

OPTIONAL: to compile JSSE classes make sure to copy JSSE/JCE 
JAR files to lib/jsse or use JDK 1.4

If you want to use other JAR files simply replace already existing
files in lib subdirectory (check README.txt files there for description).

To build everything from scratch use build script 
on UNIX it is ./build.sh and on WINDOWS build.bat refered here as "build":


	build all


when build finished execute automatic tests to verify XSOAP integrity:


	build junit
	

and you should see all tests passed successfully, similarly to:

junit:
    [junit] Testsuite: AllTests
    [junit] Tests run: 14, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 1.632 sec
    [junit]
    [junit] Testcase: testXmlEscape took 0.1 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testXmlRoundtrip took 0.01 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testPortMapping took 0.02 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testStructMapping took 0.06 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testInt took 0.1 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testFloat took 0.06 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testString took 0.01 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testObject took 0.371 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testMarshal took 0.03 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testPortTransport took 0.06 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testPortMarshal took 0.01 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testServices took 0.601 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testGUID took 0 sec
    [junit] Testcase: testAPI took 0.18 sec



Now check doc/run.txt for details on how to run samples.
