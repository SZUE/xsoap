<H1>XSOAP Overview</H2><P>

<p>XSOAP 1.2 is RMI system based on SOAP and
interoperable with Apache SOAP
(and theoretically with any other SOAP implementation).


<H2>Main features</H2>


<P>Java version of XSOAP provides:<ul>
<li><b>dynamic stubs</b> using JDK 1.3+ dynamic proxies
and does not require stub compiler to generate stubs or skeletons
<li><b>adds to SOAP a simple remote</b>
reference ie. binding of endpoint URL and interface type
<li><b>customizable XML-Java mappings</b>
and <b>multiple SOAP serialization styles</b> such as
multi-ref or recursive, optional use of xsi:type etc.
<li><b>support for multiple naming services</b> through JNDI
to act as RMI Registry, tested with OpenLDAP,
<li><b>implementation of RMI Registry</b> that is JNDI independent
<li><b>access to web services directly</b>
without need to use naming service if necessary
<li>and much much more ...
</ul>
